SocioCortex is the next generation of the collaborative information system which was developed at [sebis](wwwmatthes.in.tum.de) (TUM) for years. 

This system integrates proven features of SocioCortex's predecessor Tricia (e.g., the [Hybrid Wiki](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/1xy6w6pb8rf9j/Hybrid-Wikis) concept) 
with approaches to end-user-oriented quantitative model analysis (see [Spreadsheet 2.0](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/7hfq7554s6yv/Spreadsheet-2.0-User-Oriented-Tools-for-Analyzing-Complex-linked-Data)) 
and the support for knowledge-intensive processes (see [Darwin](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/ectby2zxvydw/Darwin-Empowering-Users-to-Collaboratively-Structure-Knowledge-Intensive-Processes)). 

By exposing its features via a standardized API, the SocioCortex plattform can serve as a foundation for the development of context-and project-specific applications.
