**1. Annotated Versioned Linked Content Graph**: Initially unstructured entities (and/or files) can be gradually structured by adding new attributes or links to other entities. 
Furthermore, SocioCortex keeps track of all changes of the entities, wherefore the user is able to observe how the entities evolved over time. 

**2. Multiple Dynamic Schemata**: This layer introduces concepts to incrementally design data models by defining types, properties, and integrity constraints. 
Those elements impose a schema to the underlying entities, whereas the system supports the user in keeping those entities consistent with respect to the defined schema. 
Together with the first layer, it implements the Hybrid Wiki conept.

**3. Role-Based & Discretionary Access Control**: This layer cares about user integration and management as well as authentication and authorization. 
Thereby roles and responsibilites are defined at schema as well as at instance level.

**4. Search Integration**: SocioCortex integrates proven and powerful technologies for faceted full-text search.

**5. Higher-Order Functional Language**: SocioCortex supports the model-based expression language ([MxL](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/xfokvh3melhh/Re14b-Type-Safety-in-EA-Model-Analysis)) as query language. 
MxL is a functional and sequence-oriented language and supports the most common query and arithmetic operators, but also more sophisticated functions (e.g., statistical functions and graph operations). 
Therefore MxL can be used for defining queries, views, data transformations, data analytics, integrity rules, and temporal reasoning.

**6. Tasks & Processes**: SocioCortex also implements a lightweight and data-oriented approach to process management in order to support knowledge-intensive processes. 
More information can be found here.

**7. Subscriptions & Event Notifications**: Users of SocioCortex can watch their data of interest and thus get automatically notified on changes.
