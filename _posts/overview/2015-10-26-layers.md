Conceptually, the envisioned SocioCortex platform consists of seven layers, whereas each layer is based on its underlying ones.

Each layer provides specific services which are exposed via the REST API, e.g., there are CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for data elements of the bottom layer.
