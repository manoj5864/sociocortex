Conceptually, the SocioCortex platform consists of seven layers, where each layer is based on its underlying ones.

Each layer provides specific services which are exposed via the REST API, i.e., there are CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for elements of each of the seven layers.

In addition to those basic layers, SocioCortex also provides facilities to integrate different kinds of data sources (e.g., relational databases) and identity providers through meta-model based connectors respectively.
