Among others, the chair for Software Engineering for Business Information Systems (sebis) at TUM conducts research onthe Enterprise Architecture (EA) management. In this area, several research projecs have been conducted by their researchers, which contains a collection of best practices, patterns and guidanceâ€™s to establish an Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) function within enterprises. 

The project  [Enterprise Architecture Visualization Tool Survey ](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/6u8f5ki1t2yz/EAVTS2014-Enterprise-Architecture-Visualization-Tool-Survey) constains the state-of-the-art in EA visualizations, addressing both the industry perspective as well as the EA tool vendor perspective. One of the conceptual frameworks for EA Visualizations described in this project is the View-driven approach to EA modeling. 

##### View-Driven Approach

The View-Driven Approach to EA modeling consist in the creation of visualizations based on initial Views (i.e Mockups), which can be created by designers, possibly with stub or dummy data, and extract the information demand based on the information necessary to generate the EA visualizations afterwards.

As a result, with SocioCortex we generated EA Visualizations with the following properties:

* Highly customized and configurable visualizations of the application landscapes
* Data connectors for multiple data sources
* Push-button for generating PowerPoint presentations
