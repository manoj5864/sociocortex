The SC Visualizer comes with a basic set of predefined visualization types, e.g., bar chart, pie chart, or cluster map. However, this set of visualization types can be easily extended by new ones or adapted to the own requirements.

## Properties of Visualization Types

Visualization types have the following types of properties:
 
- **Basic (meta) properties** include the visualization type's name, owner, and icon.
- **Data bindings** define the data interface of the visualization types, i.e., which type of data can be consumed. In addition to the name, a data binding can also possess a *restriction* property defining the type of data parameter. For this, the SC Visualizer uses the MxL type notation (see [here](http://www.sociocortex.com/tutorial/2015/12/01/mxl02/) and [here](http://www.sociocortex.com/tutorial/2015/12/01/mxl05/)).
- **Visual settings** can be used to make visual properties of the visualization type configurable, e.g., colors, formats, etc.
- **Implementation** consists of an HTML template, CSS style declarations, and JavaScript code. The *render*-function is called by the SC Visualizer when instantiating the visualization, and passes the respective instantiated data bindings and visual settings as parameters.

## Creating a Custom Visualization Type

Let us consider the following exemplary data model representing a very simple enterprise architecture, which was already introduced in the [previous lesson](http://www.sociocortex.com/tutorial/2015/12/01/visualizer01/):

In this tutorial, we want to create a new general visualization type for visualizing a directed graph, which in the context of this example can be intantiated in dashboards to visualize business applications and their information flows.

As a first step, navigate to "Visualization Types" in the top navigation bar of the SC Visualizer, and click the "NEW VISUALIZATION TYPE"-button.

We name the new visualization type "Directed Graph", and select a proper icon. Next, we define the data binding parameters as follows:

| Name     | Restriction                                                                      | Description       |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Nodes    | `Sequence<Structure<id:String, label:String>>`                                   | The nodes are defined by a sequence of complex objects, whereas each node has to have an (unique) ID and a label property. |
| Edges    | `Sequence<Structure<source:Structure<id:String>,target:Structure<id:String>>>`   | The edges are defined by a sequence of complex objects, whereas each edge has a Source and a Target object. Those objects have to define IDs which refer to the IDs of the nodes. |
