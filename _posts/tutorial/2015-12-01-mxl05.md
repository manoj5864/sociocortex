The following exemplary expressions show how MxL can be used to access and query the SocioCortex data model. For this purpose, we use a data model with Deparments, Employees, and Projects as a foundation:

![Overview over basic types of MxL]({{ "/img/tutorials/mxl/example.jpg" }})

Based on this data model, we can formulate the following queries:

The get T whereis <relation>-construct is a mechanism to navigate reversely through the data model.
