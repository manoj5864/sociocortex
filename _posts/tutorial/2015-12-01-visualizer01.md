The SC Visualizer is part of the generic client suite of SocioCortex, and empowers end-users to visualize SocioCortex's data. For this purpose, predefined visualization types (e.g., bar charts, etc.) can be bind to the SocioCortex data model in order to instantiate visualizations.

Let us consider the following exemplary data model representing a very simple enterprise architecture:

![Exemplary data model]({{ "/img/tutorials/scvisualizer/example.png" }})

Based on this data model, one can instantiate visualization types in order to visualize certain aspects of the enterprise architecture. 

## Create Your First Dashboard

As a very first example, we just want to show the number of business application on a dashboard. For this purpose, log in to the [SC Visualizer](http://visualizer.sociocortex.com/), navigate to the dashboards, and create the "NEW DASHBOARD" button on the top.

Initially, you will only see an empty dashboard grid. As a first step, just provide a meaningful name for your dashboard, choose a SocioCortex workspace which contains the data (model) you want to visualize. Furthermore, select an owner for the dashboard (this is by default you):

![Exemplary data model]({{ "/img/tutorials/scvisualizer/screen01.png" }})

As a next step, click on the "Animated Number" visualization in the list of predefined visualization types in the left sidebar in order to add it to the dashboard grid. Afterwards, you can simply resize and remove the visualization:

![Exemplary data model]({{ "/img/tutorials/scvisualizer/screen02.png" }})

Each visualization has to be configured separately, whereas this configuration consists of a name ("Number of Business Applications"), and the definition of the binding to the data as well as of the visual settings (e.g., colors, etc.).

For the selected "Animated Number" visualization type, there is only one data binding to be defined, namely the value to be shown in the visualization, and no visual setting. As indicated by the "EXPECTED" field below the textarea for the data binding, the value has to be numerical. 

At this stage, you have to transform the data of SocioCortex in a way that it fits to the data interface as defined by the visualization, i.e., in the example you have to somehow generate a number. Data transformations in SocioCortex are defined with MxL (learn more about MxL in the [respective tutorial](http://www.sociocortex.com/tutorial/2015/12/01/mxl01/)). Therefore, in order to show the number of business applications, we configure the "Animated Number" visualization with the expression `find 'Business Application'.count()`:
