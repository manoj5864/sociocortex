## Arithemtic Operations

MxL provides the common operators for the arithmetic addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`), as well as for the power operation (`^`).

Furthermore, MxL minds the usual precedence of these operators, i.e. multipliation and division will be evaluated before addition and subtraction. Round brackets may be used to apply an explicit order of evaluation.

The plus-operator is also be used for the concatenation of strings.

The following table lists some exemplary arithmetic and concatenation operations:

| Exemplary Expression | Result                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `1 + 2 * 3`          | `7`                              |
| `(1 + 2) * 3`        | `9`                              |
| `(1 - 2) / (3 + 4)`  | `-0.143`                         |
| `1 / 0`              | *Error: Division through zero*   |
| `"Hello " + "World"` | `"Hello World"`                  |

## Comparison and Logical Operators

In order to compare certain instances, MxL provides also a basic set of common comparison operators:

| Symbol | Name                    | Description                                                                                   |
| ------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `=`    | equal                   | Tests if two instances of type object are equal                                               |
| `<>`   | not equal               | Tests if two instances of type object are different                                           |
| `>`    | greater than            | Tests if the left number/date is greater/is after the right number/date                       |
| `>=`    | greater than or equal  | Tests if the left number/date is greater/is after the right number/date, or if they are equal |
| `<`    | less than               | Tests if the left number/date is less/is before the right number/date                         |
| `<=`    | less than or equal     | Tests if the left number/date is less/is before the right number/date, or if they are equal   |

All these operators return either `true` or `false`. To combine multiple comparisons, MxL provides the logical inversion, conjunction, and disjunction, whereas inversion will be evaluated before the conjunction, which in turn will be evaluated before the disjunction:

| Symbol | Description                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `not`  | Inverts the subsequent boolean value                    | 
| `and`  | Applies the logical conjunction on two boolean values   | 
| `or`   | Applies the logical disjunction on two boolean values   | 

The following table lists some exemplary comparison and logical operations:

| Exemplary Expression                     | Result    |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `1 + 2 < 3`                              | `false`   |
| `2 + 3 = 5`                              | `true`    |
| `3 + 4 > 5 and true`                     | `true`    |
| `true and false or true and not false`   | `true`    |

## Basic language Constructs

In addition to the previous mentioned operators, MxL supports the following set of language constructs:

| Name        | Syntax                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Examplary Expression                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| comment     | `/* <any comment> */`                                           | A textual comment which won't be interpreted by the MxL Parser.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `1 + /* now comes another 1 */ 1`                                |
| binding     | `let <var> = <value> in <scope>`                                | Assigns the value of `var-value` to the name `var-name`. This binding is available in the `<scope>` expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `let x = 4 + 5 in x * 2`                                         |
| conditional | 'if <cond> then <if-branch> else <else-branch>'                 | Evalutes the expression `cond`. If its value is `true`, the `if-branch` will be evaluated, otherwise the `else-branch`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `if x > 2 then "hello" else "world"`                             |
| lambda      | `(<param-name> : <param-type>, ...) => <lambda-implementation>` | A lambda-expression is an anonymous function object. The parameters of the lambda are defined before the arrow (if there is only one parameter, the brackets can be omitted), while the method stub of the lambda, which may contain the parameters as identifiers, is defined after the arrow. If the parameter types can be inferred by the environment, they can be omitted. | `let addition = (a:Number, b:Number) => a + b in addition(2,3)`  |
