The type-system of MxL consists of the following types:

| Name          | Super type    | Description and Notes       |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Object      | -           | Each element of the data model is of type Object |
| String      | Object      | Each character sequence encapsulated in quotation marks is a value of type, e.g. `"hello world"` |
| Number      | Object      | Represents both integers and decimals, e.g. `123.456` |
| Boolean     | Object      | `true` and `false` |
| Date        | Object      | A date consisting of day, month, and year. Can be constructed by the date-function and the date's string representation. The current date can be determined by the global identifier `Today`. The components of a date are accessible via day (e.g. `Today.day`), month (e.g. `Today.month`), and year (e.g. `Today.year`). |
| Map         | Object      | A dynamic collection of key-value-pairs. The constructor is written as `[k1: v1, k2: v2, ...]` (e.g., `["a": 1, "b": 2]`) while single elements of the map can be accessed via the respective element's key and the `[]` operator, e.g. `any-map["a"]`.<br/>This type can be parameterized to determine its key and value types, e.g., the type `Map<String, Number>` describes a map with *String* keys and *Number* values. |
| Structure   | Object      | A complex object having an arbitrary number of attributes. The constuctor notation is similar to the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), e.g. `{number: 1, title: "hello world"}`. The expression `{any-identifier}` is a short-cut for `{any-identifier: any-identifier}`.<br/>The *Sequence*-type can be parameterized to determine its inner structure, e.g., the type `Structure<name:String, x:Number>` describes a complex object which has an attribute *name* of type *String* as well as an attribute *x* of type *Number*. |
| Entity      | Structure   | The type entity is the base type for all user-defined entity types (e.g., *Project*, *Customer*, etc.) An entity is represented as a complex object, i.e. an object with attributes and/or references to other objects. |
| Sequence    | Object      | A sequence of values, written as `[element1, element2, ...]`. In contrast to the mathematical term "set", in sequences order matters and duplicates are allowed.<br/>The *Sequence*-type can be parameterized to determine the type of the sequence's element, e.g. the type `Sequence<Number>` defines a sequence of numbers. The elements of a sequence are accessible via `[ ]` and the element's index, whereas the index is zero-based. |
| Function    | Object      | Because the language allows higher-order functions, there are objects of type *Function*. Anonymous functions can be written as `(param1, param2, ...) => any expression`.<br/>This type can be parameterized to determine the function's signature (parameter types and return type), e.g. the type `Function<Number,Number,Boolean>` defines a function having two parameters of type Number and returning an object of type Boolean. Moreover, parameter types can be defined as optional by a question mark (the function can be invoked without optional parameters), e.g. `Function<Number, Number?, Boolean>` can be invoked for either one or two parameters. |
| Type        | Object      | A meta-type objects representing types. |
