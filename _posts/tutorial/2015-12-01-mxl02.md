The type-system of MxL consists of the following types:

| Name          | Super type    | Description and Notes       |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Object      | -           | Each element of the data model is of type Object |
| String      | Object      | Each character sequence encapsulated in quotation marks is a value of type, e.g. `"hello world"` |
| Number      | Object      | Represents both integers and decimals, e.g. `123.456` |
| Boolean     | Object      | `true` and `false` |
| Date        | Object      | A date consisting of day, month, and year. Can be constructed by the date-function and the date's string representation. The current date can be determined by the global identifier `Today`. The components of a date are accessible via day (e.g. `Today.day`), month (e.g. `Today.month`), and year (e.g. `Today.year`). |
| Map         | Object      | A dynamic collection of key-value-pairs. The constructor is written as `[k1: v1, k2: v2, ...]` (e.g., `["a": 1, "b": 2]`) while single elements of the map can be accessed via the respective element's key and the `[]` operator, e.g. `any-map["a"]`. This type can be parameterized to determine its key and value types, e.g., the type `Map<String, Number>` describes a map with *String* keys and *Number* values. |
| Structure   | Object      |                        |
| Entity      | Structure   |                        |
| Sequence    | Object      |                        |
| Function    | Object      |                        |
| Type        | Object      |                        |
