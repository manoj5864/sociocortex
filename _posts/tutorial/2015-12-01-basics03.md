While SocioCortex allows anonymous access to its resources, you have to be authenticated to access protected resources and to edit the content of SocioCortex.

Right now, SocioCortex only supports [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Therefore, you have to concate your username, a colon (':'), and your password, perform a Base64-encoding, append the prefix 'Basic ', and add it as the value of the 'Authorization' header to the HTTP request. The header for username 'sociocortex.sebis@tum.de' and password 'sebis' would look like follows:

	Authorization:  Basic c29jaW9jb3J0ZXguc2ViaXNAdHVtLmRlOnNlYmlz

To authenticate the requests when using sc-angular, use the scAuth service to store your credentials once (within the browser):

    {% highlight javascript %}
    
	scAuth.login('sociocortex.sebis@tum.de', 'sebis');

	// The following request already uses the stored credentials
	scData.Workspace.query().then(function (workspaces) {
	for (var i = 0; i < workspaces.length; i++) {
		console.log(workspaces[i].name);
	}
});
    
    {% endhighlight %}

All requests performed by sc-angular will implicitly use those credentials.
